Some people seem to have trouble reading this, understandably so. Sorry. 

The flag ends in these characters: 8fe36bc00}

I used this tool: https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#thumbnail-analysis

After a while did `thumbnail analysis`:

Used this to extract the letters: https://www.onlineocr.net/

pasted the photo here and got : flag{65c34alec121a286600ddd48fe36bc00} 

But it's not the right flag. Checked it again and 65c34al at the beginning, there is an `l`, but it should actually be `1`.

So just replace it with `1` and done.

Flag: flag{65c34a1ec121a286600ddd48fe36bc00}
